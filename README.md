Topic : Single Source Shortest Path Algorithm for Dynamic Graphs

Algorithms implemented (both for CPU and GPU) :

Static graphs : Modified Dijkstra, Bellman-ford

We got better performance on parallelised Dijkstra for static graphs as compared to Bellman-Ford hence we adapted Dijkstra for dynamic graph SSSP problem.

Dynamic graphs : Modified Dijkstra, Gradual algorithm (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/341712635_A_Single-Source_Shortest_Path_Algorithm_for_Dynamic_Graphs)
